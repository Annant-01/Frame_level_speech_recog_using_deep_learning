# Frame level speech recognition with Neural Networks #

This project was created as a part of the course IDC410 Machine Learning at IISER Mohali. 

The raw data was provided to us in the form of **mel spectrograms** (read Speech Classification) and the model classifies eahc of them as one of the 36 phoneme labels/states. 
In this coursework, I have applied 2 different neural networks(MLP and CNN) for speech classification. 
The accuracy for CNN  model was fond to be higher thn MLP in this case.
